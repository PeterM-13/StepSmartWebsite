                <p>
                    The idea of Stepsmart came from a place of the heart. 
                    The founders working in a large company at the time - saw the real-life struggles of work colleagues who had to balance a full-time job, 
                    alongside caring responsibilities.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Further research shows that this is not a stand-alone issue. 
                    1/7 people within the UK workforce are considered “Carers,” 
                    and with a rapidly ageing population, 
                    it is expected that this figure will only rise in the future.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Helping to find a way to help reduce this pressure on the working population will become paramount, 
                    and so our team formed to make Stepsmart.

                <p>
                    Innovation is what sets the Stepsmart walking stick apart from other sticks on the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ergonomic designs of both the handle and the foot were integral to our designs. 
                    In order to get this blend just right, it took the team hours of researching, 
                    poring over feedback and mass amounts of prototyping. 
                    This approach not only led to a design we know you will love but also the invention of our specialised patent foot design.
